## Problem solving approach

1. Understand the Problem

2. Explore Concrete Examples

3. Break It down

4. Solve/ Simplify

5. Look Back and Refactor

# Problem Solving Patterns

## Frequency Counters Pattern

-   Using objects, sets to collect value/frequencies of values
-   Can often avoid nested loop or O(n^2) operations with arrays/strings

## Multiple Pointers

-   Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on certain condition
-   Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well

## Sliding Window

-   Create a window: can either be an array or number from one position to another
-   Depending on certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created)
-   Useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string

## Divide and Conquer

-   dividing a data set into smaller chunks then repeating a process with a subset of data
-   Can extremely decrease time complexity
